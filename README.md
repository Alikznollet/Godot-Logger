# Godot-Logger
My personal logging solution in Godot. Makes use of the new Logger class in Godot v4.5+.

### Notes

- `` Project Settings > Debug > Settings > GDScript > Always Track Call Stacks `` should be enabled for the logging to work properly.
- Disable the default Godot logging in `` Project Settings > Debug > File Logging ``
